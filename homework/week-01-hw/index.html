<p> Hi, I'm Blair.</p>
<p>In college, I studied Business Administration and International Studies (a mix of political science and law). In life, I study design. The design of a photograph for one. Capturing an object in unique light. Catching a personal off guard. Looking at a landscape from upside down. I also study design in terms of the web. I have an idea and I want to transform it onto the page. My favorite part about designing a website is choosing the layout, colors and fonts. It is what brings the page to life.</p>
<p>A little bit more about me. I am an avid quoter of How I Met Your Mother. I believe I am the woman-version of Ted Mosby. He's a little weird. A hopeless romantic. Philosophical. Not afraid to be who he is. My spirit animal if you will.</p>
<p>I also really love music. It keeps me focused. Even while I am at work I am listening to music. I do accounting for a living. I have heard (haha no pun intended...maybe) that a lot of people can't concentrate that well while they do math if music is playing. I'm the opposite. My favorite genres are indie rock and country. My favorite song changes weekly and my favorite band changes monthly. Right now my favorite song is "Renegades" by the X Ambassadors, but I am really into Tim McGraw.</p>
<p>Some other random facts about me: My favorite food is sushi. I like taking long drives (not long walks on the beach). I want to learn how to ride a motorcycle. I am a Philadelphia Eagles fan despite living in New Jersey.</p>
